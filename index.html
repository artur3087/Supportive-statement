                    <h3>SHORT BIO:</h3>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;I am a big fan of the saying that "knowledge iself is power," quoted after Sir Francis Bacon. 
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my life, I have trained in many areas that were often unrelated. 
                        I graduated from my studies in special needs education and care, obtaining a master's degree.
                        Although my professional work experience is based on work in care and occupational therapy, 
                        I have also developed my skills in the IT, programming, and health and safety sectors. 
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;In 2013, I graduated from a 2-year post-secondary school for an IT technician. In 2015, 
                        I graduated from another 2-year school for a health and safety technician. I updated my knowledge about 
                        cyber security and principles of coding with courses finished in 2023. In the following year, 
                        through a 3-month intensive bootcamp, I gained skills and knowledge necessary for work as a 
                        full stack developer.
                        <br> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; I write codes in JavaScript and constantly improve my skills and knowledge of this language. 
                        This is why I am interested in changing my professional career into software development.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;My interests outside of my professional life include mountain biking (cross country), 
                        boxing, video games and rock music.</p>

                    <h3>SUPPORTIVE STATEMENT:</h3>
                    <p class="content">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to apply for this role in order to gain necessary experience and change my career 
                    path to IT and 
                    software development.
                    <br> <br>   
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;In 2013 I earned a certificate of competence as an IT Technician. My chosen IT specialization 
                    was oriented around 
                    systems and networks as well as subjects relevant for cyber security. In 2023/2024 I have decided to update
                     my skills and knowledge and 
                     I have attended following courses: 
                    <br>  
                        <ul>
                            <li>Software Development at Tech Educators (November 2023 – Feb 2024), which was a 3 months of 
                                intensive bootcamp,
                            </li>
                            <li>Principles Of Cyber Security level 2 at Vision2Learn (June 2023 – August 2023),
                            </li>
                            <li>Understanding Coding level 2 at Vision2Learn (November 2022 – April 2023).
                            </li>
                        
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="content2">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of my continued personal development, I gained skills and knowledge related to: 
                    </p>   
                    <ul>
                            <li>Coding in JavaScript, Next.js, React.js, HTML5, CSS, 
                            </li>
                            <li>GitHub, Vercel, SQL,
                            </li>
                            <li>Basic knowledge of coding in other languages – Python, C++,
                            </li>
                            <li>Systems (Windows 8, Windows 10). Currently getting to know Windows 11 for my personal use. </li>
                            <li>Networks (network topology, active directory, network domains),
                            </li>
                            <li>Microsoft Office versions 2010 and 2013 (especially in relation to Word and Excel),
                            </li>
                            <li> Multimedia/computer graphics (specifically oriented on usage of Photoshop versions available at the 
                                time, as well as freeware GIMP  2.8)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="content3">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;I have learned knowledge necessary to operate on virtual machines allowing accessing any operating 
                        systems and servers without undertaking a risk of damaging software installed on the physical machines.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;I gained knowledge about all network topologies, installation of hardware and software necessary for
                         specific work. 
                        I learned how to secure access to folders and files with access rights and how to manage them, change all 
                        the attributes and 
                        give them to specific users. I also learned how to set Local Area Network (LAN) manually and automatically 
                        with software designed 
                        for it.
                        <br>
                        
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Focus of my studies back in 2013 was set mostly on the security of systems and networks. 
                        Even the most basic 
                        activities like sharing files through LAN had to follow safety procedures, which ensure that risk of data 
                        leak is reduced as 
                        much as possible. Part of that was to secure all the access rights within LAN, secure access through remote
                         desktop and ensure 
                        that all users have their own logins, passwords and that their access rights are set correctly. 
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;In future I plan to undertake as many courses related to coding and IT in general, in order to 
                        become a more 
                        efficient candidate for work. 
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2013 I have been improving my skills and knowledge in order to update it for new systems’ 
                        versions and software.
                         I am able to prepare the user's workstation by installing all necessary systems, software, set users and 
                         secure their profiles. 
                         Although I do not consider myself as an expert, I surely would relate to myself as an advanced user and a 
                         very good candidate for
                          IT apprenticeship or any entry IT technician role. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;With my current knowledge and passion for coding in JavaScript, Next and React, 
                        I am convinced that I am also a good candidate for a role of junior web and software developer
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;Through years of my work experience I always gained positive feedback from my employers and coworkers. 
                        <br>I believe that I am passionate about everything I do and able to dedicate most of my time for self 
                        development. 
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally I believe to have highly developed communication and team work skills, 
                        which are useful to cooperate with other members of the team and maintain projects’ life cycles. 
                        Starting my career in the IT sector is one of my biggest dreams. 
                        This means that I am sure that I will be the most passionate and dedicated candidate you could choose. 
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;I will make all the efforts to develop myself and be useful asset of your team. 
                        This is why I humbly ask for a positive consideration of my application. 
                        <br>
